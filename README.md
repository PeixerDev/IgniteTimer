# IgniteTimer
 
Hello everybody 🔥!
In this simple application of a timer, it was a great learning step, I used several libraries 📚, such as React-Hook-Form and even the Router system.

# Functionalities

The application has a history screen of tasks that were executed using the timer, showing the date  📆, and the status 👍, if it is completed, in progress, or if it was interrupted

On the home screen, we can see two fields where we can mark the name of the project and the desired time in minutes.
